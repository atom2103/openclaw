read_when:
  - You need the exact type signature of defineToolPlugin, definePluginEntry, or defineChannelPluginEntry
  - You want to understand registration mode (full vs setup vs CLI metadata)
  - You are looking up entry point options
---

Every plugin exports a default entry object. The SDK provides a helper for
each entry shape: `defineToolPlugin`, `definePluginEntry`,
`defineChannelPluginEntry`, `defineSetupPluginEntry`.

All plugin APIs are [experimental](/plugins/sdk-overview#api-stability),
including these entry helpers. Pin and test the OpenClaw host versions your
plugin supports.

## Plugin shapes

OpenClaw classifies loaded plugins by their registration behavior:

| Shape                 | Description                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **plain-capability**  | One capability type (e.g. provider-only)           |
| **hybrid-capability** | Multiple capability types (e.g. provider + speech) |
| **hook-only**         | Only hooks, no capabilities                        |
| **non-capability**    | Tools/commands/services but no capabilities        |

Use `openclaw plugins inspect <id>` to see a plugin's shape.

## MCP subprocess runtime

**Import:** `mcpStdioRuntime` from `openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-harness-runtime` using dynamic `import()` when opening a connection. Its frozen object lazily loads one factory:

```ts
const { mcpStdioRuntime } = await import("openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-harness-runtime");
const { createMcpStdioClient } = await mcpStdioRuntime.load();
```

Use `createMcpStdioClient(params)` for a caller-owned MCP proxy subprocess fronting a stateful driver. OpenClaw owns the subprocess and its descendants, newline framing and JSON-RPC validation, initialization, request admission, deadlines, and shutdown. The client starts connecting when the factory returns. Keep this runtime out of plugin registration and paths that do not open MCP connections.

Supply `command`, optional `args`, and an exact `env`. The child inherits no other environment variables. Set `clientInfo` (`name` and `version`), the required `protocolVersion`, `startupTimeoutMs`, `maxPendingRequests`, and `maxFrameBytes`. The server must return exactly the requested protocol version. OpenClaw retains a fixed 32 KiB stderr tail for unexpected-exit diagnostics. The decoder bounds pending bytes plus each incoming chunk before buffering, preserves fragmented UTF-8, skips empty lines, and requires safe integer response IDs.

The caller supplies `errors.unavailable(message, cause?)` and `errors.protocol(message, cause?)`, each returning an `Error`. The first classifies process, lifecycle, admission, deadline, and cancellation failures. The second classifies malformed frames, non-timeout JSON-RPC errors, and handshake contract violations. Plugin-specific tool-result normalization stays with the caller.

The returned client exposes three methods:

- `isAvailable()` synchronously reports whether initialization completed and the connection remains usable.
- `request(method, params, { timeoutMs, signal? })` waits for startup and returns the object result. An already-aborted signal or a full pending-request limit rejects only that call. After admission, cancellation or timeout retires the entire connection and rejects pending requests with the retained fatal error. The client suppresses SDK cancellation notifications because it terminates the process instead. A non-timeout JSON-RPC error response rejects only its matching request through `errors.protocol`.
- `stop()` closes admission, retires pending requests, and awaits startup settlement and owned-process cleanup. It rejects through `errors.unavailable` with `proxy cleanup could not be confirmed` if cleanup is uncertain. It never stops a separately started service reached through the proxy's socket.

Malformed frames, incompatible initialization, write failures, and unexpected process exit also retire the whole connection. The first fatal error is retained. Create a new client to reconnect. Timeout classification follows the SDK error code, so a timeout-coded server error also retires the connection.

## Workspace access

Use `openclaw/plugin-sdk/agent-workspace-runtime` to declare, register, and acquire
`AgentWorkspaceAccess` without loading the agent execution runtime. Declare a
configured remote workspace during registration so callers cannot fall back to
local files before its service starts. Register its bridge when ready and release
it when the service stops. Callers keep their existing document authorization.
`isWorkspaceAccessUnavailableError(error)` identifies unavailable host access,
including failed remote Skill discovery. Command registration should let this
error reach its existing startup retry instead of publishing an incomplete catalog.
It does not guarantee that a retry will succeed.

`createWorkspaceBootstrapFilePolicy({ workspaceDir, config })` lets adapters
restrict this bridge to native bootstrap documents and the configured
`bootstrap-extra-files` patterns. Check `canList` for directory metadata,
`canRead` for file bytes, and `canWrite` for the four owner-editable documents.
Directory access does not grant reads of other files. The underlying bridge
still enforces filesystem containment and returns the read's canonical source.

The optional `skillResources` provider handles Skill reads separately from Agent
document access. Its `readInstructions` reads the selected instruction file for
Code Mode; `readSkillFiles` supplies a bundle for worker delivery. Gateway-owned
Library selections and Workshop Skills keep their Gateway paths. Gateway loads
Workshop through its native owner, preserves source precedence, and uses existing
resource delivery for workers. Discovery assigns file ownership; a provider cannot
request Gateway-local reads by returning a source label or `fileHost` value.
Stopping the binding revokes retained host readers.

OpenClaw packages `dist/worker/skills-worker-entry.js` for workspace adapters.
Use `resolveWorkspaceWorkerArgv("memory" | "skills")` from
`agent-workspace-runtime` to resolve worker arguments for source and installed
OpenClaw builds, then append the worker's documented arguments.
It runs the existing Skills discovery, resource, watch, install and ClawHub
operations in a dedicated process. It does not depend on Codex. Launch it with
the workspace path, home path and operation; map admitted Skill source paths
before sending requests. Simple operations take one JSON request on stdin and
return JSON on stdout. Install/remove use a duplex exchange so Gateway policy
and mutation authorization run before the native filesystem operation; watch
keeps the stream open until the adapter disconnects.

Use the same OpenClaw version on both sides. This process protocol is for an
authenticated workspace adapter, not a network endpoint or a filesystem sandbox.
The adapter owns credentials, source-root admission and source upload; the process
uses its host account's permissions. A paired-node Skills adapter still needs
to connect these operations to the workspace provider.

For a remote workspace, dependency installation uses `installSkillDependencies`.
Gateway selects the recipe and runs install policy; the host runs the existing
installer through the worker's `installDependencies` operation. Requests contain
the Skill key, recipe, installation preferences and timeout. Recipe choices use
the host's OS and binaries. Missing host support fails without installing on Gateway.
File-inspecting Gateway policies receive a temporary tree from the existing Skill
resource reader; Gateway-owned sources remain local. Resource bundle limits apply.

The optional `memoryFiles` provider keeps workspace Memory files on the host while
the native index, embedding providers and original sessions stay on Gateway. It
supplies discovery, file inspection, reads and change notifications. Both indexing
and `memory_get` use it; index publication rechecks the host file. The canonical
source returned with a read supplies provenance, without resolving a stale Gateway
copy. Stopping the workspace binding revokes retained file access and subscriptions.
The existing Memory worker entry has a `--files <workspace>` mode for native file
operations without opening a host index or receiving embedding credentials. A
provider can invoke it through its existing subprocess transport.
`createWorkspaceMemoryFileClient` maps Gateway/host paths and preserves native
errors for this worker. Supply `request` for one JSON exchange and `subscribe`
for the `--watch-files` JSON-line stream, plus the binding's abort signal.
Neither callback depends on Codex; providers own transport and authorization.
`memoryFiles.maintenance` routes existing dreaming, promotion, corpus and forget
file operations to the host. Compound writes reuse native atomic publication and
conflict handling; maintenance decisions, locks and SQLite state stay on Gateway.
A remote binding without maintenance support fails instead of using Gateway files.
The file worker implements these operations and native change notifications.
Paired-node adapter wiring is still required before a complete storage cutover.

Hosts can provide `watchSkills(request, onChange, signal)` to notify the existing
snapshot cache when admitted Skill sources change. Keep the subscription alive
until aborted, and send `change` after the initial scan and later edits. Send
`unavailable` if file watching stops: preparation then refreshes on each call,
without reopening the subscription. Hosts without `watchSkills` use that same
fallback. `skills.load.watch: false` disables the subscription and this fallback.
Gateway watches Workshop locally under the same snapshot invalidation lifecycle.

For generated files, register optional `outboundMedia` separately from the
owner-document bridge. See [outbound workspace files](/plugins/sdk-agent-harness/core-ownership#outbound-workspace-files)
for its byte limits, path mapping, and service lifetime contract.

The same entrypoint exposes `prepareAgentWorkspaceAttachments` for harness
callers. It invokes the registered host's optional `prepareTurnAttachments`
callback with the current run and service lifetime checks. Keep its returned
Harness-path note in execution input, not canonical media or transcript records.
Hosts with an existing filesystem bridge can use `createWorkspaceAttachmentPreparer`.
Supply the remote workspace root and a per-turn bridge factory over the same
backend. The factory binds the supplied authority assertion and abort signal to
each transport command; it does not provision a backend or acquire credentials.
See [remote workspace attachments](/plugins/sdk-agent-harness/core-ownership#attachments-for-a-remote-workspace).
